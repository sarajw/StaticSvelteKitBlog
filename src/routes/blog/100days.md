exerpt: Copying and pasting my tweets on the matter (until I work out how to automate that) as I slowly make my way through the 100 days. Not consecutively.

## Day 11/#100DaysOfCode
Arguing with some aspects of @sveltejs because it seems every which way of making a website involves some fudging, somewhere! Otherwise, I like it very much as a ‘modern’ way of building websites :)

Also still tussling with PowerShell at work…

## Day 10/#100DaysOfCode
Already 10% done?

I have a blog! A static one! Built with @sveltejs! Temporary site is here: https://pensive-murdock-678461.netlify.app

The design is… hm. Trying to harmonise it with http://sarawallen.com. Very Under Construction 🏗️👷

With thanks to @jjcollinsworth :)

## Day 9/#100DaysOfCode
More PowerShell, more SvelteKit static blog building.

With the latter I really should finish the tutorial before messing with parts of it, because inevitably it gets around to what I want to try anyway, and does whatever it is way more efficiently! ^_^

## Day 8/#100DaysOfCode
“Let’s learn SvelteKit by building a static Markdown blog from scratch”
\- @jjcollinsworth

Wish me luck!

## Day 7/#100DaysOfCode
On the day job at @MKtimelapse - playing with PowerShell and using it to create a file list for ffmpeg to turn into an auto-generated time-lapse movie.

I did it a while ago so first I’m trying to understand my old code (🤦) before I adapt it to new uses…

## Day 6/#100DaysOfCode
Oops. Opening a Svelte project in VSCode just closed the Next one. I guess now I know that happens, glad it prompted me to save before it went.

Also having a first peek at webflow, even if that’s in opposition to what I’m trying to learn. I’m intrigued.

## Day 5/#100DaysOfCode
Managing to eke out an hour before I go to bed. I’m pausing the next.js tutorial because the svelte one is right in front of me and isn’t requiring me to look at a video right now - I much prefer text/interaction based stuff!

## Day 4/#100DaysOfCode
Still on @thenetninjauk’s Next.js tutorial - now we’re actually getting into more JavaScript!

I’m still stuck between “Ooo this is clever” and “All this abstraction feels so unnecessary…” - but then I haven’t built huge dynamic sites or apps (…yet!)

## Not-a-Day/#100DaysOfCode
Not managing to do one of the #100DaysOfCode today, but thinking about planning…

Currently doing a Next.js tutorial
Depending on how I feel at the end of that, I may or may not look at React or Svelte.
Next project goal: Make myself a blog site.

## Day 3/#100DaysOfCode
Continuing @thenetninjauk’s Next.js tutorial :ninja:

## Day 2/#100DaysOfCode
Edited some text in the landing page I made for my friend http://yasmin-brinkmann.com :)

Kicking myself about the things I don’t know by heart on https://css-speedrun.netlify.app !

Learning that using Google Fonts without hosting them locally is not GDPR-compliant!

## So. #100DaysOfCode - let’s do this.
They won’t be consecutive. But I will account for them.

Day 1/100 - setting myself up to have a play with @nextjs

Smart to skip over React entirely to play here first? Who knows! Don’t know until I try…
