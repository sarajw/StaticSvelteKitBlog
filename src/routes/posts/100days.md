## Day 16/#100DaysOfCode 

Added a pop colour to my 'blogolio' amongst other little fixes. The front, stuff and contact pages need content.

I also need to work on my main landing page - I want to keep it, but the styling needs an overhaul, and I must locally host the font...

### Day 16 continued
Notes to self:
* Focus highlighting - outline (+offset?) or border? ‚úÖ done
* Prioritise accessibility.
* Consider elements expanding in place instead of introducing modals, ooh.
* Host http://sarawallen.com font(s) locally.
* Make the ascii-art text responsive.

## Day 15/#100DaysOfCode

Battled windows command line, installing make, but failing to compile a TTF-WOFF2 converter. Never mind, I managed to get hold of the woff2 font file I wanted in the end!

Svelte blog also progressing, using CSS grid a bit more. Separating out components :)

## Day 14/#100DaysOfCode

Got confused in svelte when a bit of simple JS wouldn't work, but then have found the native IF setup to be a much better solution thanks to the help from the discord!

Working on making my own pop-up/modal component for use in my portfolio/stuff section :)

### Day 14 continued

Notes to self before bed:

Fix padding discrepancy between /blog and /stuff on mobile

Reconsider popup position (fixed? absolute?) and how to darken rest of site behind it (huge box shadow? Is that legit CSS?)

Add content:
Contact 
Front page (hero?)

## Day 13/#100DaysOfCode 

2nd attempt at the svelte static blog looks good, and now I'm trying to build out the portfolio/stuff section.

There are so many cool complex things you can do in webdev frameworks, but I'm taking baby steps - I want to (mostly) understand what I'm doing!

### Day 13 continued

Just to add that I'm getting some great support from the @SvelteSociety and @KevinJPowell's discord servers, not to mention conversations I've had here on twitter.

I'm so thankful for the communities around development üôè‚ô•Ô∏è

## Day 12/#100DaysOfCode

Ooof:

I made a mess out of moving project folders around on my computer, so lost most of the last version of the blog I was making in @sveltejs!

Then I missed out a forward slash which meant the built version of my new one couldn't see fonts and images ü§¶

### Day 12 continued

The upshot of this is I've just learned how I /should/ be using assets in SvelteKit,<br>~and~<br>
the new version is now being pushed to GitHub from the start - and therefore also now being auto-built and deployed on Netlify. Winner.

## Day 11/#100DaysOfCode

Arguing with some aspects of @sveltejs because it seems every which way of making a website involves some fudging, somewhere! Otherwise, I like it very much as a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô way of building websites :)

Also still tussling with PowerShell at work‚Ä¶

## Day 10/#100DaysOfCode

Already 10% done?

I have a blog! A static one! Built with @sveltejs! Temporary site is here: https://pensive-murdock-678461.netlify.app

The design is‚Ä¶ hm. Trying to harmonise it with http://sarawallen.com. Very Under Construction üèóÔ∏èüë∑

With thanks to @jjcollinsworth :)

## Day 9/#100DaysOfCode

More PowerShell, more SvelteKit static blog building.

With the latter I really should finish the tutorial before messing with parts of it, because inevitably it gets around to what I want to try anyway, and does whatever it is way more efficiently! ^_^

## Day 8/#100DaysOfCode

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs learn SvelteKit by building a static Markdown blog from scratch‚Äù
\- @jjcollinsworth

Wish me luck!

## Day 7/#100DaysOfCode

On the day job at @MKtimelapse - playing with PowerShell and using it to create a file list for ffmpeg to turn into an auto-generated time-lapse movie.

I did it a while ago so first I‚Äôm trying to understand my old code (ü§¶) before I adapt it to new uses‚Ä¶

## Day 6/#100DaysOfCode

Oops. Opening a Svelte project in VSCode just closed the Next one. I guess now I know that happens, glad it prompted me to save before it went.

Also having a first peek at webflow, even if that‚Äôs in opposition to what I‚Äôm trying to learn. I‚Äôm intrigued.

## Day 5/#100DaysOfCode

Managing to eke out an hour before I go to bed. I‚Äôm pausing the next.js tutorial because the svelte one is right in front of me and isn‚Äôt requiring me to look at a video right now - I much prefer text/interaction based stuff!

## Day 4/#100DaysOfCode

Still on @thenetninjauk‚Äôs Next.js tutorial - now we‚Äôre actually getting into more JavaScript!

I‚Äôm still stuck between ‚ÄúOoo this is clever‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll this abstraction feels so unnecessary‚Ä¶‚Äù - but then I haven‚Äôt built huge dynamic sites or apps (‚Ä¶yet!)

## Not-a-Day/#100DaysOfCode

Not managing to do one of the #100DaysOfCode today, but thinking about planning‚Ä¶

Currently doing a Next.js tutorial
Depending on how I feel at the end of that, I may or may not look at React or Svelte.
Next project goal: Make myself a blog site.

## Day 3/#100DaysOfCode

Continuing @thenetninjauk‚Äôs Next.js tutorial :ninja:

## Day 2/#100DaysOfCode

Edited some text in the landing page I made for my friend http://yasmin-brinkmann.com :)

Kicking myself about the things I don‚Äôt know by heart on https://css-speedrun.netlify.app !

Learning that using Google Fonts without hosting them locally is not GDPR-compliant!

## So. #100DaysOfCode - let‚Äôs do this.

They won‚Äôt be consecutive. But I will account for them.

Day 1/100 - setting myself up to have a play with @nextjs

Smart to skip over React entirely to play here first? Who knows! Don‚Äôt know until I try‚Ä¶
